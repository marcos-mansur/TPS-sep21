# Hello!

This is my project for the tabular data competition of september from kaggle.

I'm going to build a neural network (hopefully one that can actually learn) and compare it to XGBoost and LGBM. 

It's my first time dealing with this much data and the objective is to learn how to build a good NN, explore XGBoost, LGBM and hyperparameter tuning with OPTUNA.
